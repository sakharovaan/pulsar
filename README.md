# Pulsar

![pulsar](docs/assets/pulsar-poster.png)

An inference engine for giant Mixture-of-Experts models on hardware that
has no business running them. The routed experts live on NVMe and stream
per token; everything that makes decisions stays resident in VRAM. No
llama.cpp anywhere in the stack.

Successor to [NeutronStar](https://github.com/giannisanni/neutronstar),
rebuilt as its own engine in Rust + CUDA instead of a C fork. A pulsar is
a neutron star that spins fast and emits beams.

## What it does today

Eleven model architectures running on consumer GPUs: **Hy3 295B**
(hy-v3, GQA), **GLM-5.2 743B** (glm-dsa, MLA + DSA sparse attention),
**Kimi K2.7 1T** (deepseek2, MLA + YaRN), **MiniMax M3** (partial
rotary, swiglu_oai), **Gemma 4 26B-A4B** (interleaved sliding-window
attention, dual GELU FFN), **TML Inkling 1T** (no rope, learned
relative-position bias, shortconv streams, sink router; supported the
day after release), **Qwen3-235B-A22B** (qwen3moe, softmax router;
correct output on its first-ever run), **DeepSeek-V4-Flash 284B**
(deepseek4: 4-stream hyper-connection residual with Sinkhorn gates,
sink attention over a sliding window plus streaming compressed KV,
fp8/fp4 cache quantization-aware sims, token-id hash routing on the
early layers; also correct output on its first-ever run), and
**Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** (qwen35moe hybrid: Gated DeltaNet linear attention
with O(1) recurrent state on 3 of every 4 layers, sigmoid-gated full
attention on the rest - 262k context with KV on only 10 of 40 layers,
needle recall verified at 45k tokens with 19.6 tok/s decode at that
depth; prefer K-quants for it: the Q4_K_XL decodes at 51.8 tok/s where
the smaller Q3_K_XL manages 36, because iq3's codebook lookups are
decode compute the simple K-quant shifts don't pay), and
**gpt-oss 20B** (gpt-oss: per-head attention sinks in the softmax
denominator, alternating sliding/full attention, biases on both the
attention projections and every expert, MXFP4 routed experts), and
**Laguna-S-2.1 118B** (laguna: hybrid attention with a full-window
layer every fourth and sliding-window 512 elsewhere, a per-head output
gate, and per-layer-type RoPE — YaRN on the full-window layers, plain
on the sliding ones; the imatrix IQ2_XXS build decodes faster than the
Q4_K_M because more experts stay resident at 36GB), and
**Ornith-397B** (a `qwen35moe` hybrid at 397B: Q2_K experts on a 512-way
sigmoid-gated router with a shared expert, Gated DeltaNet linear
attention as above; runs end-to-end on a single 32GB GPU after a load-site
fix — see `docs/ornith-q2k-cuda-crash-fix.md`). Reference

All figures are sustained warm decode at n=64, temp 0, second run onward.
The resident tier is placed from the popularity census, which builds over
the first full run, so measure with a warm census. Shorter generations read
higher because the per-token SSD miss rate is still climbing to steady state:
Hy3 does 8.2 tok/s at n=32 versus 6.0 at n=64. Gemma is small enough that its
whole quantized weight set lives resident in the tier, so warm Gemma is
compute-bound, not streaming-bound.

† Measured before the n=64 standardization and not yet re-run (model deleted
to free disk); the sustained rate is likely a little lower than shown, for
the same reason Hy3 reads 8.2 at n=32 against 6.0 at n=64.

†† Ornith-397B was brought up on a different box (3090 + V100 32GB GPU, 128Gb),
not the reference 2×16GB rig, and only a short cold-census 15-token run exists
(`-p "The capital of France is" -n 15` → "Paris.", correct, 0.82 tok/s cold).
That is a bring-up smoke test, not a benchmark: n=15 off a cold census with the
disk as the floor. The rate column stays empty until `scripts/bench.sh` has run
on it, per the rule that every number in this table comes from that script and
nowhere else. The 149GB gguf
size is the experts-Q2_K / rest-Q8_0 mix from `pulsar-quant --map "_exps.=q2_k"
--default q8_0`.

ThinkingCap-27B is pulsar's first fully-dense arch and runs a different
mode entirely: no streaming, no tiers - the model fits across both
cards, so each layer's whole stack (attention or Gated DeltaNet, KV,
FFN triple) is resident on ONE owner card in native K-quant, evaluated
with warp-cooperative Q4_K/Q6_K matmuls on q8_K activations, and the
residual stream crosses cards twice per 16-token chunk. Speculative
decode rides the model's own nextn/MTP layer (`PULSAR_MTP=1`, depth via
`PULSAR_MTP_DEPTH`, 85% acceptance at depth 3 on greedy); verify rounds
snapshot the recurrent GDN state, since unlike KV rows a delta-rule
state can't be overwritten after a rejected draft. The port went 9.7 ->
18.3 tok/s base (27.5 with MTP) in one arc: per-layer card ownership,
K-quant-native attention, a warp token tile so verify/prefill rows
share one weight read (ncu: L1-bound at 94%, DRAM 28% - the next lever
is the int8-MMA path the MoE verify unions already use).

DeepSeek-V4-Flash runs its state machines (sliding-window ring,
streaming KV compressor, Sinkhorn hyper-connection gates) fully on
device and prefills in batched 16-token chunks (~26 tok/s prefill
with the CPU lane at shallow positions; past ~2K context the indexer
top-k engages and the batched path used to fall back to single-token
steps, decaying prefill to decode speed ~8 tok/s. Deep chunks now stay
batched with per-token visibility masks - a 3.4K prompt drops 249s to
137s, larger prompts save proportionally more. The float delta vs
single-stepping that briefly kept this opt-in was root-caused to
matmul_q8_0's batch-size kernel dispatch (dp4a vs int8-MMA accumulate
in different orders, tolerance-tested at 1e-3) - the same documented
drift class as the tiers and grouped MoE, present in every chunked
prefill. PULSAR_NO_DEEP_BATCH=1 restores exact single-stepping. one router readback and one expert union per
chunk-layer, with the per-token ring/compressor/attention interleave
preserved bit-exactly). Long-context retrieval verified by needle
recall at 2.4k ctx through compressed rows.

Long context on the GQA models decodes through a split-K attention
kernel: past 4k visible rows the position scan fans out across blocks
(2k rows per split, unnormalized online-softmax partials, one combine
pass) instead of serializing inside a single block per head. Measured
on Qwen3.6 at 45k tokens: needle recall correct, decode 3.7 to 19.6
tok/s (5.3x); at 10.8k tokens recall is also verified. Short contexts
take the original kernel unchanged, so bit-exact gates and the 51.8
tok/s bench are untouched. Known remaining lever: each q-head group
re-reads its shared kv-head rows, so a kv-head-centric layout has
several-fold headroom left at depth.

A CPU expert lane (opt-in, `PULSAR_CPU=1`) computes host-cache-hit
experts on the CPU instead of uploading them: AVX2 iq2_xxs and q2_K
x q8_K kernels sustain 42 GB/s across the 9900X's cores, above the
28.7 GB/s the same bytes would cost crossing PCIe, and the dots
overlap the GPU resolve. Host-cached experts stop competing for
upload bandwidth and VRAM cache slots, so both effects compound:
DeepSeek-V4-Flash measures 8.2 to 11.3 tok/s, Hy3 6.0 to 6.9, GLM-5.2
2.7 to 2.8 (re-measured 2026-07-19 after an iq2_xxs correctness fix:
the CPU dot had been indexing the encoder-unit grid instead of the
dequant lattice, scaling every lane partial by ~1/9 per dot - GLM
surfaced it as repetition loops, and a one-row GPU-vs-CPU arbiter now
pins the dot to the kernel bit-for-bit-scale; earlier lane numbers
were measured with the broken dot and are superseded by these).
GLM's pair moved again on 2026-07-25 when a prefill prefetch bug was
fixed, and the lane's margin there narrowed from +41% to +6%: much of
what the lane had been buying on that model was insulation from the
flood's cache thrashing, not upload bandwidth. Covers iq2_xxs, iq2_xs, iq3_xxs, q2_K, q3_K and q4_K
expert tensors, which spans the ds4 recipes and the UD-Q2_K_XL mixes:
Qwen3-235B 5.3 to 6.4 (+21%), TML Inkling 1.63 to 1.75 (+7%),
MiniMax M3 5.0 to 5.9 (+18%; its IQ mix engages on 54 of 57 MoE
layers, the three iq4_xs-down layers stay on the GPU). Baselines for
dsv4/Hy3/M3 re-measured 2026-07-19 with the triple-aware warm load
(PR #2); 235B and Inkling predate it (ggufs rotated off disk).

Decode rate slides with output length on the streaming models: a longer
generation routes to a wider set of experts, so the disk-miss fraction
creeps up until the working set saturates. Hy3's length scan (measured
before the triple warm load; the shape holds, the levels read ~10% low
now): 5.7 tok/s at n=64, 4.5 at n=128, 4.2 at n=256, converging toward
a ~4 tok/s floor set by how
much of the expert working set fits in host RAM (more RAM lifts the whole
curve). n=64 is the reported standard; long outputs run nearer the floor.
Gemma is exempt: its weights are fully resident, so no disk is in the loop.

Prefill runs the quantized weights through int8 tensor cores: Hy3
**28 tok/s** (1.8× over dp4a, ds4 0.44), GLM-5.2 **15 tok/s** (2.7×).
Warm start: hot experts bulk-load in **~3s**. (ds4 = NeutronStar, the
llama.cpp-fork predecessor, on the same box.)

Decode figures are **warm-run** (second run onward). The first run is
cold while the expert-popularity census fills; only after it is written
do the host cache and resident tiers load hot, so a cold run reads far
more from disk and clocks lower, so don't benchmark the first run. On the
reference box Gemma 4 goes 28.7 tok/s cold → 41 tok/s warm (hot experts
resident on the second GPU). See the warm-start note under Quick start.

Prefill runs the quantized weights through int8 tensor cores on
sm_80+ (`mma.m16n8k32` dense GEMM + mmq-style grouped MoE that unpacks
each expert superblock to shared memory once per prefill chunk and
rescales per quant block in registers), 1.8–2.7× over the dp4a
kernels, which remain the path on older GPUs. Decode is single-token
and memory-bound, so it is deliberately untouched: ids stay
bit-identical to the dp4a path.

GLM runs contexts past its naive 2048-row ceiling via a port of the
DSA lightning indexer (top-k row selection per token), validated
against the reference engine with a long-context retrieval probe. The
indexer's batch scorer runs on tensor cores (f16 keys, m16n8k16 with the
relu-weight epilogue fused between heads): 1.9x long-prompt prefill at
4k context, byte-identical ids vs the scalar path, and the index K cache
halves to f16 (the reference indexer ships FP8 in production).

On a single RTX 4060 Ti (where NeutronStar set its numbers): Hy3 2.6,
GLM 0.56.

**Zero-config multi-GPU.** At startup pulsar *measures* each card's H2D
bandwidth (labels lie: an x8-labeled slot can train x1, a driver bug can
park a Gen5 card at Gen1, only a measurement sees that) and assigns
roles by what each card is actually good at:

- **Expert streaming** needs link bandwidth → the fastest measured card.
- **Attention residency** (MLA models: the whole ~14GB attn stack + KV
  parked on a second card) only needs capacity, weights cross the bus
  once at load, then only activations hop (2× 24KB per layer). A
  bandwidth-crippled card serves attention at full speed.
- **Expert tiers**: leftover cards are filled with the hottest expert
  triples from the warm census, and the MoE kernels *run on the card
  that holds the weights*, partial outputs gather back over PCIe. On
  the reference box the tier serves ~90% of expert computations and
  nearly doubles Hy3 decode.

Correctness is certified against ds4, not assumed: teacher-forced along
ds4's greedy path (15/16 per-position argmax agreement on Hy3, 10/12 on
GLM, every miss at a <0.09-logit tie), byte-identical greedy ids across
single-GPU vs attn-offload configurations, and bit-exact decode
determinism on a fixed code path (`--decode-consistency`, below).

## Requirements

- Linux (io_uring and CUDA are load-bearing; the workspace *compiles* on
  macOS but the engine is stubbed out there)
- One or more NVIDIA GPUs, GTX 10-series (Pascal, sm_61) or newer, the
  default build ships native code for 10/16/20, 30, and 40-series plus
  PTX that JITs on everything else (50-series Blackwell, Volta, Hopper).
  `PULSAR_CUDA_ARCH` overrides codegen targets
- CUDA toolkit with `nvcc` on PATH, plus a host compiler nvcc accepts
  (gcc-12 works; newer gcc may need `CXX=g++-12` at build time)
- Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
- The model gguf on a fast NVMe, streaming reads it at up to ~7GB/s,
  so the disk *is* the decode speed
- ~16GB system RAM for the host-side expert cache (more helps; the cache
  budget is the single biggest knob after the disk)

## Get a model

Pulsar reads standard llama.cpp ggufs: ten routed-expert quant
formats (q2_K, q3_K, q4_0, q4_K, q5_K, q5_1, q6_K, iq2_xxs, iq2_xs,
iq3_xxs, including fused gate_up tensors and non-256-multiple expert
widths), K-quant dense tensors (requantized to q8_0 at load), tied
embeddings, split -00001-of-000NN shard sets (point `-m` at the first
shard), and both converter dialects (ds4-lineage and upstream).
Known-good starters:

```sh
# Hy3 295B - 85GB, the friendlier starting point (fromBF16 = current build)
curl -L -C - -o Hy3-ds4-IQ2XXS-AttnQ8-fromBF16.gguf \
  "https://huggingface.co/giannisan/Hy3-ds4-gguf/resolve/main/Hy3-ds4-IQ2XXS-AttnQ8-fromBF16.gguf"

# GLM-5.2 743B - 197GB, needs a second 16GB GPU for the attention stack
curl -L -C - -o GLM-5.2-UD-IQ2_XXS_RoutedIQ2XXS_blk78Q2K.gguf \
  "https://huggingface.co/antirez/GLM-5.2-GGUF/resolve/main/GLM-5.2-UD-IQ2_XXS_RoutedIQ2XXS_blk78Q2K.gguf"

# Kimi K2.7-Code 1T - 339GB in 8 shards (unsloth UD-Q2_K_XL); download
# the folder and point pulsar at shard -00001-of-00008
```

Put the file on your fastest NVMe - decode speed is read speed.

First run is cold. On exit the engine writes a `<model>.gguf.warm`
sidecar (a popularity census of expert slabs); every later run bulk-loads
the hot set in a few seconds, and expert tiers (spare GPUs) fill from the
same census, so the second run is the fast one.

When no census exists yet, the engine seeds the warm set and tier
placement from a built-in per-family hotlist (`crates/engine/hotlists/`,
generated from real routing censuses with the `hotlist-gen` tool, keyed
by layer/expert index so it survives requantized ggufs). Measured on
Qwen3.6-35B: first-run decode 19.2 to 25.1 tok/s, with the resident tier
active from token one. The real census replaces the seed on exit;
`PULSAR_NO_HOTLIST=1` restores the plain cold start. Idea borrowed from
the static streaming hotlists in antirez's ds4 (MIT).

### Chat templates

Same policy for **`pulsar-serve`** and **`pulsar-cli --chat`**.

Two encoding paths:

1. **ChatMarkers** (**default**) — hardcoded special-token layouts for Hy3,
   Kimi, ChatML/Qwen, Gemma, MiniMax, Inkling, DeepSeek, GLM, Laguna,
   Harmony (gpt-oss), Kimi K3. Carefully tuned for thinking modes and stop
   sets. Used unless you opt in. **No network.**
2. **Jinja** — HuggingFace-style templates via minijinja. **Opt-in only**
   via `--jinja-chat` or `PULSAR_JINJA_CHAT=1`, even when the GGUF embeds
   `tokenizer.chat_template`. There is no separate `--fetch-template`
   flag: opting into Jinja is enough to allow network rollover.

**Template resolution** (only when `--jinja-chat`; first hit wins):

1. Embedded `tokenizer.chat_template` in the GGUF header
2. Local disk cache (`$PULSAR_TEMPLATE_CACHE` / platform cache)
3. HuggingFace `tokenizer_config.json` (quant base-model walk)
4. llama.cpp `models/templates` catalog on GitHub

Without `--jinja-chat`, neither binary resolves beyond an offline peek
(CLI load log only). With Jinja on, steps 3–4 run unless
`PULSAR_OFFLINE=1` (then embed + cache only).

```sh
# dump / save a template (standalone tool; may use network unless --offline)
./target/release/get-chat-template Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct --meta
./target/release/get-chat-template /path/to/model-Q4_K_M.gguf --save out.jinja

# default ChatMarkers (no network)
./target/release/pulsar-serve -m model.gguf
./target/release/pulsar-cli -m model.gguf --chat

# Jinja: embed → cache → HF → llama.cpp catalog
./target/release/pulsar-serve -m model.gguf --jinja-chat
./target/release/pulsar-cli -m model.gguf --chat --jinja-chat

# Jinja offline only (embed + local cache)
PULSAR_OFFLINE=1 ./target/release/pulsar-serve -m model.gguf --jinja-chat
PULSAR_OFFLINE=1 ./target/release/pulsar-cli -m model.gguf --chat --jinja-chat
```

Gated HF repos need `HF_TOKEN`. Apply failures log and fall back to
ChatMarkers for that request/turn. Full reference:
[docs/chat_template.md](docs/chat_template.md).

### Tuning knobs (env vars)

Everything auto-configures; these override. Shared by `pulsar-cli` and
`pulsar-serve` unless noted.

#### Device / placement

| var | default | what |
|---|---|---|

#### KV cache / memory

| var | default | what |
|---|---|---|

Lossy formats are opt-in so default decode stays bit-exact. **MLA / Dsv4:** latent KV only honors `f32` \| `fp8` \| `fp16` (`turbo*` is GQA-only). `auto` may pick `fp8` when f32 KV would not fit.

VRAM for larger host / dev expert caches.

### Tests

```sh
cargo test                                        # host-side (any OS)
CXX=g++-12 cargo test -p kernels --release -- --test-threads=1   # GPU kernel selftests vs CPU references
scripts/check.sh /path/to/model.gguf              # full commit gate (build + selftests + bit-exact decode)
```

## How the streaming works

Per MoE layer, per token (or per prefill chunk as a union across the
whole batch), an expert slab resolves through:

1. **Resident tier** (spare GPUs): the hottest expert triples live
   permanently on leftover cards; their MoE compute happens *there* and
   only activations cross PCIe. Placement, not cache: no eviction.
2. **VRAM hot-set cache** (primary GPU): a fixed pool with touch-count
   admission: a slab earns a slot only by being hotter than the coldest
   resident, so the pool holds a *stable* hot set instead of thrashing.
3. **Host LFU cache**: RAM-budgeted, persisted to the `.warm` sidecar.
4. **io_uring + O_DIRECT**: misses are fetched at queue depth 32, and
   each completion is uploaded to the GPU while the remaining reads are
   still in flight.

A background thread additionally **prefetches the next layer's experts**,
predicted by running the next layer's router on the current layer's
input.

The MoE kernels never consult global state: every launch receives
explicit per-(token, slot) device pointers for gate/up/down, and a NULL
slot means "not mine", which is what makes per-card partial execution
native. Where the bytes came from is the host's problem, resolved before
launch.

## Fidelity notes

- All matmuls use ds4's exact math: activations quantized to q8_0/q8_K,
  integer dp4a dots. Logit-level parity with ds4 is within quantization
  noise.
- Batched prefill and single-token decode use different reduction
  orders, so greedy near-ties (top1−top2 < ~0.5 logits) can flip between
  them, the same class of drift ds4 has between its CUDA and Metal
  backends. `--decode-consistency N` measures it; with `PULSAR_BATCH=1`
  the two paths are identical and the comparison is bit-exact (verified:
  max |Δlogit| = 0.0).
- Expert tiers split the per-slot sum across cards, which reorders float
  adds, same drift class. `PULSAR_TIERS=off` restores the single-device
  exact path. Attention offload does NOT drift: ids are byte-identical
  with and without it.

## Status / roadmap

Done: gguf reader · io_uring disk path (parity with C at 4.8GB/s) ·
hy-v3 + glm-dsa (MLA compact-KV) forward graphs with GPU-vs-CPU kernel
selftests · from-gguf BPE tokenizer (gold-vector parity with ds4) ·
four-tier streaming · warm-cache persistence · batch prefill ·
cross-layer prefetch · measured-bandwidth GPU role assignment · MLA
attention residency on a second GPU · resident expert tiers on spare
GPUs · temp/top-p/min-p sampling · interactive chat · OpenAI-compatible
server (`pulsar-serve`: `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions` with SSE
streaming plus a built-in chat web UI at `/`, no build step, embedded via
`include_str!`; local single-user, one request at a time). The web UI
ships an **expert Atlas** tab: it plots every routed expert from `/experts`
by where its weights live (VRAM core / RAM-cache ring / disk rim), dot
size tracking routing heat — instant on model load, no command or build
step. Drop a `<model>.atlas.json` sidecar in place (from
`scripts/atlas_build.py`: routes ~40 topic probes, diffs per-expert heat,
PCA to 2D) and the view upgrades to a topic-affinity galaxy; the UI polls
for the sidecar and swaps automatically when it appears.

Done since: DSA lightning indexer (GLM contexts past 2048, batch scorer
on tensor cores) · Kimi K2.7/deepseek2 with llama.cpp-exact YaRN ·
split-gguf loading · MTP + draft-free n-gram speculation (built,
measured honestly: net-slower until the host cache outruns the disk;
`PULSAR_MTP=1` / `PULSAR_NGRAM=n` to experiment) · style-aware chat
templates (Hy3/Kimi/ChatML/Gemma/MiniMax/Inkling/DeepSeek/GLM/Laguna/Harmony/K3)
plus opt-in Jinja chat templates on serve and CLI (`--jinja-chat`; embed →
cache → HF → llama.cpp catalog; no separate fetch flag; `get-chat-template`
CLI) · int8
tensor-core prefill (dense GEMM + grouped MoE) · MiniMax M3, Qwen3,
Gemma 4, TML Inkling forward graphs · opt-in fp8 e4m3 KV cache
(`PULSAR_KV=fp8`) · TurboQuant rotated block-KV (`PULSAR_KV=turbo4|turbo8`,
orthogonal Π on K/Q spreads outliers so block-quant stops zeroing the
other 31 lanes; decode-invariant, V untouched) · `pulsar-quant` recipe quantizer (BF16 gguf →
ds4-style expert mixes, iq2_xxs with imatrix, per-tensor `--map`
rules; removes llama.cpp from the model-prep pipeline; shard
streaming: `--fetch-cmd`/`--delete-shards` quantize sources bigger
than the disk one shard at a time) ·
DeepSeek-V4-Flash (deepseek4): hyper-connection residual streams,
streaming compressed KV + sink attention, indexer QAT top-k, token-id
hash routing.
Ornith-397B (qwen35moe at 397B): the largest qwen35-moe hybrid yet —
Q2_K experts on a 512-way router, GDN linear attention, shared expert.
Runs end-to-end after fixing three f32-reader load sites that the
generic `upload()` path left as raw/reqantized bytes (conv1d, gate_inp,
gate_inp_shexp); see `docs/ornith-q2k-cuda-crash-fix.md`. Warm decode
bench pending.

Also done, honestly measured: DFlash block-diffusion speculative
decoding for Qwen3.6 (the lucebox recipe: a 515MB matched draft
proposes 16 tokens conditioned on 5 captured target hidden states, one
batched target forward verifies the block, recurrent state snapshots
roll back rejections). The machinery works - structured text accepts
whole 16-blocks - but it ships opt-in experimental
(`PULSAR_DFLASH=draft.gguf`) because on the reference box it is
experimental. Four profiling rounds took it from 6.1 to 39.7 tok/s
(resident expert tiers for the hybrid families, grouped tensor-core
MoE for verify chunks, recurrence-only fast rollback that replaces the
replay forward, a token-tiled K-quant lm head), and on the iq3-heavy
Q3_K_XL target it now BEATS sequential decode on reasoning workloads
(39.7 vs 36.3, byte-identical output to plain greedy). On the faster
Q4_K_XL target sequential decode itself jumps to 51.8 tok/s and DFlash
falls behind again: the round's remaining fixed costs (a ~95ms verify
floor of per-layer launches and router readbacks, a draft whose cost
grows with the feature window) need acceptance ~7+ to amortize, and
measured acceptance is 4.3 on math, less on prose.
MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool-use in pulsar-serve, opt-in via
`--webui-mcp-proxy`: the server connects to configured MCP servers
(rmcp 3.0.1; stdio + streamable-http), exposes their tools to the model
as namespaced `server__tool` specs, and runs a non-stream agentic loop
(MAX_TURNS=8) that executes the model's `<tool_call>` blocks and feeds
results back. Each server card's title auto-detects the advertised name
from the MCP `initialize` handshake and shows a rolling connection log
with the last handshake latency; the on/off pill matches the CPU Lane /
MTP toggles. Full CRUD lives in the web UI sidebar (add/edit/remove
servers, enable/disable per tool), persisted to `mcp.json`. Without the
flag: zero behavioral change — every `/mcp/*` route 404s and the sidebar
group stays hidden. End-to-end verified on Qwen3.6-35B against a remote
SearXNG MCP (tool_call → dispatch → grounded answer in ~22s). See
`docs/mcp-server.md`.

Not yet:

- DFlash, remaining: draft context-KV cache ring (lucebox
  DraftKvCacheRefs - caps the draft cost at long windows), CUDA-graph
  or fused launches for the verify's per-layer fixed costs, tree
  verification (DDTree) for higher acceptance per round
- deepseek4 perf pass: batched prefill (prompts currently process
  sequentially), resident tiers + cross-layer prefetch for the dsv4
  resolve, fewer host syncs on the hyper-connection gates
- tensor-core unpackers for the remaining expert formats (iq2_xs,
  iq3_xxs, q4_K, q5_1, q2_K, q3_K, the harness takes one ~40-line
  unpacker per format)
